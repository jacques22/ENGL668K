Roma Roma Roma
now I  ? come ? prima
Thy ? William
Prima waters  their in whom
Some brightly spirit lived, & die
That decaying ? consume
Which its mysterious faintly hid
For the  Thy ?
They its as her find a tomb
That he
Underneath  this pyramid
Lies thy bones – if ? cannot die
???? – their ? a shine

Where art thou ? my gentle ? ?
Dignified ? loving words
Whose ? ? think thy ? ? 
Within its ???? interior ?
The grass living  love of living flowers
Among these tombs & ruins wild
Could I believe that
