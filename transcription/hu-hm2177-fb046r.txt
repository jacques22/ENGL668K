With what he ? I may say
Born a Born a Born a
Non e finis, come era prima
there is where
Some brightly sprirt lived, and died
That decaying were consume
Which its history faintly hid
I lay its ashes find a tomb
That he underneath this pryamid
Lies thy bones - if ? cannot die
Rest they to ? - their ? a shrine

Where art thou my gentle child
Dignified mothers loving words
Whose I think thy spirit ? few
Within its mother's interior mind
The love of living flowers
Among these tombs and ruins wild
